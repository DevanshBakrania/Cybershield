# CyberShield 🔐

**CyberShield** is a privacy-first mobile security suite built using **Flutter**.  
It combines transparent device security auditing with a stealth, decoy-driven encrypted vault, allowing users to protect sensitive data while maintaining plausible deniability.

Designed to appear as a standard security utility, CyberShield hides powerful protection mechanisms beneath a clean and minimal interface — **all without relying on cloud services.**
